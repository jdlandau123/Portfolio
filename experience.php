        In this role I was the GIS Developer on the RISE team, contracted by the US Bureau of Reclamation. Some 
        notable projects I worked on include migrating the old map interface from ArcGIS Web AppBuilder to ArcGIS
        Experience Builder and rewriting a .NET codebase which performs data aggregation and map generation. In addition,
        I also performed regular development tasks including updating the API, containerizing services for deployment,
        and assisting with the front end.

        At Innovate I have been able to work on a wide range of interesting projects for both private and 
        government clients. Some of the tasks that I frequently work on include developing new and existing REST 
        API services using Django REST Framework, building complex user interfaces with Angular, and integrating 
        geospatial datasets into our applications with ESRI's ArcGIS Enterprise tooling.

        As lead back-end engineer I have been able to design and implement this application's architecture and 
        back-end services from the ground up. This has included developing a Django REST API, implementing scalable 
        and asynchronous background processing with Celery, and employing Docker to containerize and deploy the 
        application via an Nginx web server. I also contributed to the application's user interface, which is built 
        with React using Material UI.

        My GIS knowledge grew immensely during my time at Tehama. The core responsibilities of this position 
        involved interpreting, manipulating, visualizing, and managing large geospatial datasets. The main tools 
        I used to accomplish these tasks included Python, SQL, and ArcGIS Pro.

        Being my first full-time position after graduting from Florida State University, my time at Quantum 
        Spatial was foundational to my professional development. In this position I was responsible for creating 
        and maintaining many large geospatial datasets. I also had the opportunity to use my Python skills to 
        develop some custom automated workflows for data processing and formatting.
